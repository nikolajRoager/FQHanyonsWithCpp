Direct diagonalization works perfectly as one would expect.

Apart from a few random crashes (To be expected with iterative algorithms).

Performance is far superior to MPS formalism for "small" systems, highlighting superiority of Armadillo.

Performance completely tanks when system size increases. Anything with 5 particles on a 6 by 6 grid is completely impossible to work with at all.
